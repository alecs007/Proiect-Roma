# <h1 align="center"><strong><em>Proiect Roma🏛️</em></strong></h1>


**Proiect Roma** is a page dedicated to the main monuments of Rome. On the website you can find information about:

	•  Colosseum
	•  Panteon
	•  Forumul Roman
	•  Vatican
	•  Columna lui Traian
	•  Via Appia
	•  Fontana di Trevi
	•  Piazza Navona

The website was created as a school project and I used HTML and SCSS languages ​​to create it. The purpose of this site is to provide a simple and clear presentation of the most important places in Rome.

**I want to specify that this is one of my first web projects and every information is in Romanian.**
