# <h1 align="center"><strong><em>Proiect Roma üèõÔ∏è</em></strong></h1>


**Proiect Roma** is a page dedicated to the main monuments of Rome. On the website you can find information about:

    ‚Ä¢ Colosseum
    ‚Ä¢ Panteon
    ‚Ä¢ Forumul Roman
    ‚Ä¢ Vatican
    ‚Ä¢ Columna lui Traian
    ‚Ä¢ Via Appia
    ‚Ä¢ Fontana di Trevi
    ‚Ä¢ Piazza Navona

The website was created as a school project and I used HTML and SCSS languages ‚Äã‚Äãto create it. The purpose of this site is to provide a simple and clear presentation of the most important places in Rome.

**I want to specify that this is one of my first web projects and every information is in Romanian.**
